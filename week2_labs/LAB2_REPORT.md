## Technical Skills Developed

### Git Version Control
- Understanding of repository concepts
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branch management and merging
- Remote repository collaboration

### Flet GUI Development
- Flet 0.28.3 syntax and components
- Page configuration and layout management
- Event handling and user interaction
- Modern UI design principles

## Challenges and Solutions

None, I just simply follow the instructions and all went well and smooth

## Learning Outcomes

In this activity, I learned how to set up my GitHub account and use commands like commit and push to save and upload my work. I realized that version control is helpful for keeping track of changes and makes it easier to work with others on the same project.

## Screenshots

### Git Repository
- [ ] GitHub repository with commit history
- [ ] Local git log showing commits

### GUI Applications
- [ ] hello_flet.py running with all features
- [ ] personal_info_gui.py with filled form and generated profile

## Future Enhancements

I suggest adding a save feature so the output can be stored and viewed later, and also improving the appearance of the GUI to make it more attractive and user-friendly.
