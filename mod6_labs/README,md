### Module 6 Learning Task - Weather Application Enhancement
- `mod6_labs/main.py` - Weather Application main file that builds the window and lay out the visible components
- `mod6_labs/config.py` - Handles configuration management, including API keys, base URLs, and environment variable for the Weather Application.
- `mod6_labs/weather_service.py` - Contains the service layer responsible for communicating with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather and forecast data, including error handling and async HTTP requests.
- `mod6_labs/test_weather_service.py` - Unit test file that validates the functionality and reliability of the `WeatherService` class, ensuring correct API responses and proper error handling.


### Features Enhancement Added in Weather Application
1. Search History (Easy)
-Store the last 5-10 searched cities 
- Display them in a dropdown or list
- Allow quick re-search by clicking on history items
- Persist history using local file storage (json file)

2. Temperature Unit Toggle (Easy)
